## Target file
`solution.py` — write the completed class here. Do **not** modify
any other file in the project root.

## Verification discipline
Every test intent in feature_list.json is a **RUNTIME CHECK**. The
Tester must write a temp Python script, execute it via the Bash
tool, and compare actual stdout to expected. Code review alone is
never sufficient.
